Wanted to migrate or sync your playlists between music services? We got you! 

### Features (in develpment)
- Send your playlists to other music services, so you always have that one playlist that hits just right in every service 
- Keep your playlists in sync by selecting a main service and our backend will replicate the library in your other platforms
- Share your playlists with everyone, no matter the platform they use (as long as we support it).

### Platforms 
- Spotify (almost done)
- Deezer (Work in process)
- Amazon Music (Planned)

I want to extend support to more platforms as soon as possible, but there are some problems: 
- Apple Music\
  Apple requires a $99 anual payment for their developer program. This means that anyone trying to host this api themselves would need to pay said price.\
  As much as i want to also host this project myself, I do not have the money to pay Apple + hosting. I'll keep this project on free platforms like Render as much as possible to save money. Shit ain't easy 'round here
  
- Tidal\
   I'm still doing some research on this one, but their API don't seem to help. It covers mostly public data, not allowing to read/write data to user library\
  
- TikTok Music (New name for Resso)\ 
  It's a newer platform, so I'll focus on this one later. I can't even find information about their API\

If you know a platform that is good to work with (aka not charging developers for it), please open an issue and share it there. Also feel free to open a PR and implement it yourself, if you want to  

### No frontend?
This project is meant to be a platform/framework for anyone to build upon. In early development, the main focus is to provide a functional API. Facilitating development for specific platforms is a thing that will come later\
This also means that i am not going to build a frontend for it in the close future. That's your task!

### Running locally
As the project is new and in constant change, I will not provide a Docker image or quick setup guide.\
Because of the nature of development process in early stages, most updates will break compatibility with the version before. Once things get more stable, it will be a priority

### Documentation 
Same problem as the category above. Once things are more stable it will be done

### Contributing
Guidelines for code will come later. For now, bug reports and the solution to those bugs are the best way to do it.\
